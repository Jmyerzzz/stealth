# Stealth Project
This repository serves as a placeholder for a stealth project I am working on with one of my peers.

During my time without a full time role I have kept busy with a few small freelance project and this project which is a bit larger in scale. The goal of this project is to create an MVP that we can present to pre-seed investors and continue to scale. I am currently the sole engineer building out the product and my partner is gathering all business logic which, together, we translate into engineering requirements.

The repository holding the code for this project will remain private; however, I would be happy to discuss high level details on a call. What I can share is that this software is for the freight/trucking industry and is aimed at unifying a currently disjointed software experience in this industry.
